# FaceDetection

Detecting face in the image using the OpenCV library in Python.
Training the classifiers using several positive and negative images.
Positive images are the images with face and negative images are the ones without face.
The algorithm is trained with the facial features in the training images.
The features with the minimum error-rate are considered to be the images that classify the part with face and the one with non-face.
OpenCV has a classifier and the detector that detects the prominent facial part in the image.
